                        I feel like I was a little bit late to catch up with blockchain trend. But better later than never, right?

                    <h3>d number</h3>
                    <p>d number is the first smart contract I have written on Ethereum network. 
                        
                        Collection of tokens in d number represents a decimal number between [0,10).
                        
                        Each new ERC721 token generated in this contract adds a new decimal place to d number. As new tokens are generated, the value of the number changes.

                        There is a script with generates a unique metadata image for each token, based on token data (last digit, digit history, level, id). Each digit value change on a token generates a new image with new parameters.

                        To get your first dPlace, go to <a href="https://dnum.xyz">https://dnum.xyz</a>

                        <p>
                            &gt; I decided to use it as a personal gallery, so I started filling it with images, nfts, music, 3d objects I have.

                            &gt; I keep updating my build on parcel by putting more content; so you may see new things next time you visit. It's getting more packed and weird with new additions, but making weird looking stuff by playing html ui parameters is hella fun I should say.
